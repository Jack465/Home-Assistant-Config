TODO:
* Write out the Readme.md file, detailing the automations, devices and software used etc
* Include AppDaemon Dashboard (possibly in another repo)
* Refactor all automations 
* Use Pyscript (HACS) instead of the built in "python_script". will make it 10x easier to write a proper python script, not some junk
